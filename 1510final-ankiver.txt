ch.08	initiate an array list that holds 5 Car objects in an array called cars.	Car[] cars = new Car[5];
ch.08	main String(args []), how do you pass pennsylvania, texas and arizona into a StateEval.java file in the command line?	java StateEval pennsylvania texas arizona
ch.08	"initiate a variable parameter list called ""list"", that stores different integers in a function called average that returns double value."	public double average(int ... list) {}
ch.08	initiate a two-dimentional array called table that has dimensions of 12 and 50	int[][] table = new int[12][50];
ch.08	compare Selection and Insertion sorting	<ul><li>both algorithms are similar in efficiency</li><li>they both have outer and inner loops that scan all the elements</li><li>inner loops that compare the values in the outer loop with all the values in the list</li><li>n^2 comparasons are made to sort a list with size n</li></ul>
ch.08	What is big O notation?	"<ul><li>its math notation used to describe the performance/complexity of an algorithm in terms of its input size</li><li>O stands for ""order of""</li><li>Constant Time: O</li><li>Logarithmic Time: O(log[N])</li><li>Linear Time: O(N)</li><li>Linearithmic Time: O(N log[N])</li><li>Quadratic Time: O(N^2)</li><li>Exponential Time: O(2^N)</li></ul>"
ch.08	What are the two types of searching in arrays?	Linear and Binary
ch.08	what is Linear Search?	Begins at one end, and examines each element in turn. Either the element is found and it stops, or it encounters the end.
ch.08	what is Binary Search?	It compares the middle element with remaining viable candidates. It eliminates half the remaining data. It stops when the target is found or the data is exhausted.
ch.07	How do you create software?	<ol><li>Establish the requirements</li><li>Create a design</li><li>Implement the code</li><li>Testing the implementation</li></ol>
